# Godot_game-template_2D
this is a template for a 2D side scrolling platform game,or with a few tweeks could be for any game really.
title screen leading to main scene with save and load functions
saves score to a HUD and the player position in the game,also saves persistent data of collected items,so they do not reappear when reloading.
cant figure out how to put the reload button on the title screen as the main scene needs to load first,so please feel free to solve this problem
